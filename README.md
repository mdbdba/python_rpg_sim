# Overview and Inspiration
It all started with a blog post, 
“Data Analytics: D&D 5e Character Optimization!” (2018/04/18), published here: http://imagine.kicbak.com/blog/?p=261

In that blog, the author, Matthew W. Johnson, looked at the four basic D&D classes: Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard; 
and attempted to compare their effectiveness through combat. That sounded like a great idea to me, 
but I’d like to repeat this experiment, expanding on it with how I like to play, 
and add some other functionality.  It seemed like an excellent opportunity to apply some of the things 
I’ve learned in Python. If you'd like to read more, check out the full blog post:
